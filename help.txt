Welcome to Tunnel Rush!
You are trapped in an infinite octahedron shaped tunnel and run on the bottom side. 
You need to travel as much distance as possible while dodging both stationary and moving obstacles. To dodge
obstacles, you can rotate the tunnel to change the bottom side or jump. 
After every 1500 meters, you will enter a new level with a completely different world to play in. At each level, we will gradually increase the speed of your travel as well as the speed of rotation of the obstacles, making them harder to dodge.
Another obstacle in your way is flashbangs at random times which will blind you momentarily and you might hit an obstacle in that time if you are not fast enough!!

CONTROLS:
- A/Left Arrow - Rotate Left
- D/Right Arrow - Rotate Right
- Space - Jump
- P - Pause
- G - Toggle between grayscale and RGB
